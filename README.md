# CRM Risk Analysis Dashboard 🧮
This project demonstrates how to analyze and segment customer risk levels using both Excel and HubSpot CRM. It is split into two parts:

## 📊 Part 1: Excel-Based Risk Dashboard
In this phase, mock customer data is used to:
- Categorize clients into High, Medium, and Low Risk levels
- Visualize risk distribution using Pivot Charts and Pie Charts
- Use formulas like:
  - `=COUNTIF()` for risk counts
  - `=COUNTA()` for total customers
  - Slicers and Pivot Tables for interactivity

🔍 **Key Features:**
- Risk segmentation by payment behavior
- Interactive Excel dashboard
- Slicers for filtering by status or risk level
